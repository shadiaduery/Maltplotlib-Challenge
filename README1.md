Observations:

1) The experiment was composed of 249 mice, 10 Drug Regimens, almost all Regimens had 25 mice assign mice sex were closely diveded 50/50 male/female

2) Each Drug Regimen was tested over 10 Timepoints (range 0-45), each mouse in the experiment had a cancerous tumor at its largest volume at the beginning of the trial.

3) After conducting the trial, each Drug Regimen was tested for outlier points, and none had them

4) Sampling the mouse assigned to the Capomulin Drug Regimen, we tested the strength of the correlation between avegage mouse weight and tumor volumen, and we found a strong correlation 0.84

5) sampling one mouse treated under the Capomulin Regimen it was observed that there was a reduction of the tumor volume over time, the tumor volume was reduced in almost half by timepoint 45.
